      <h4>Things To Do In Cuba</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="firstline">Eat delicious street food</span>. Small businesses are cropping up all over Cuba’s streets and many new entrepreneurs are focusing on street food. Try pork hamburgers, fruit milkshakes, and coconut pies, to name a few. Here are <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ninawolpow/the-5-best-street-foods-in-havana#.wi2WZwyeR" target="_blank">five street foods you should try</a> in Havana.</li></br>
        <li><span class="firstline">Learn to Salsa at 1830.</span>To many Cubans, salsa moves seem to come as natural as walking. But don’t let their professional-level skills deter you — the dance culture in Cuba is all about doing it together. For a crash course, hang out during salsa night at the outdoor club <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147271-d2286480-Reviews-1830-Havana_Cuba.html" target="_blank">1830</a> and fall into step with a local.</li></br>
        <li><span class="firstline">Hang out in Plaza Vieja.</span>From art galleries to a beer museum, Havana’s “Old Plaza” has tons of culture going on. The outdoor cafes are a great place to spend an afternoon (though this is definitely one of the more touristy activities on this list) sipping from three-foot-high beer towers — or only slightly smaller mojitos.</li>

      <h4>Things to do in Italia</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="firstline">Hike between the 5 villages of Cinque Terre.</span> A National Park and Unesco World Heritage site, allegedly the cleanest area of Italy and a mesmerizing jewel in the Ligurian crown - the Cinque terre (5 lands) escape any description. The five adorable villages precariously nested on the rugged cliffs of the Italian Riviera - Monterosso, Vernazza, Manarola, Corniglia, and Riomaggiore - sprawl along the scenic portion of the azure coast between Levanto and La Spezia. Brimming with olive groves, vineyards, hiking trails and tranquil coves, the place oozes romance and relaxating ambiance. A definite must!</li></br>
        <li><span class="firstline">Relive history at the Colosseum.</span> The greatest remnant of the antiquity, the archetypal amphitheater, an engineering wonder, the epitome of architectural excellence, a standing proof of both the grandeur and the cruelty of the Roman world - the Colosseum has been dubbed myriad ways, but there's just no way of grasping their meaning until you see the blues of the sky through the perfectly curved arches.

      <h3>Switzerland</h3>

      <h4>Things to do in Switzerland</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="firstline">Visit Chateau de Chillon.</span> Boasting a spectacular location on the eastern edge of Lake Geneva and framed with craggy mountains, the Chillon Castle is an unforgettable sight. Somewhat distant and surreal as it virtually rises from the water, this medieval fort and a famous prison is among the best-preserved specimens in Europe. Allow enough time for a leisurely tour of the Grand Hall, the Hall of Justice, the Armouries, Saint George's Chapel and more of the stronghold's days gone by. Soak up the austere atmosphere visiting the underground Bonivard Prison and explore the stunning surroundings by shoreline walks or charming boat cruises.</li></br>
        <li><span class="firstline"> Hike The Matterhorn - Zermatt.</span> It is exactly here, in the tiny village of Zemratt, where the nature-loving hikers can make a perfect start of their trips into the majestic kingdom of towering Alps. There are over 400 kilometers of hiking trails, footpaths and walks that will trek you to the breathtaking natural wonders, amaze with rugged alpine landscapes and make you feel small and humble at the foot of the sky-cutting Matternhorn. Although the mount is not Switzerland's highest, it certainly is the best known alpine peak and a challenge for many with its 4478 meters and steep climbs. Whether you venture a strenuous walk up and a ramble down or not, you deserve some pampering in Zemratt, which, although small, is one of Europe's premier ski resorts with comfy accommodation and cuisine hard to resist.</li></br>
        <li><span class="firstline"> Go skiing in Grindelwald.</span>This is one of the few resorts in the Bernese Oberland that occasionally mistakes itself for a genuine city rather than an artificial tourist creation. It offers a healthy dose of restaurants, bars, discos, and, unfortunately, traffic. There are a lot of affordable accommodations here -- it's not nearly as snobby as some of the other resorts. Many skiers use it as a base camp for long-haul excursions to the slopes of First, Männlichen, and Kleine Scheidegg. From Grindelwald, the resorts of Wengen and Mürren are accessible by cog railway and/or cable car (no traffic!).</li>
